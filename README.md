# Listing-4_16 : How to generate a random upper case letter.

## Introduction

This document details the generation of a Java program that writes an uppercase letter to the console. This code is managed inside Github.com and uses the Math.random() method as well as a custom method call.

## Outline
``` java
// Generate a random uppercase letter (using a custom method call)
// 'A' is 65
				
/* 'Z' is 90, and we wanted to cover the range, so we added 1 more to ensure	
we would cover A through Z.*/

// From page 122 a + Math.random()*b gives us a random number between a and a+b excluding a+b.

/* Make a new variable and then fill it with a random number that is between our starting value
and ending value. Then print it out.*/ 

// Generate a random number

// recast the number to a letter.

// Print the random letter to the console.
```

  number between a and a+b excluding a+b.*/

## Code
```java
public class listing4_16 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		// 'A' is 65
		int startingValue = 65;
		
		/* 'Z' is 90,
		and we wanted to cover the range, so we added 1 more to ensure
		we would cover A through Z.*/
		int endingValue = 90-startingValue+1;
	   
		/* From page 122 a + Math.random()*b gives us a random
		 * number between a and a+b excluding a+b.*/
		
		/* Make a new variable and then 
		fill it with a random number that is between our starting value
		and ending value. Then print it out. */
		int randomNumber;
		System.out.println("The random uppercase letter is:");
		 // Generate a random number
		randomNumber = (int)(startingValue + Math.random()*endingValue);
	    // recast the number to a letter.
		char letter = (char)randomNumber; 	
		// print it out.
		System.out.println(letter); 		

	}

}
```

## Summary
Writing a program to generate random uppercase letters and using markdown. I learned that to write this code, I have to recast numbers to letters with letter “A” being number 65 and “Z” being 90 as seen in Liang Java 10th edition. Pg 125, Table 4.4 Characters A to Z have a Value in Decimal of 65 to 90. I also learned how to make random number that is int number1 = (int)(Math.random()*10); that is going to correspond with the random uppercase letter [randomNumber = (int)(startingValue + Math.random()*endingValue); ] ranging from 65 to 90 and A to Z. To cover the range, so we added one more to ensure we would cover A through Z.



## Command Prompt

1. Open Eclipse and start new project
	a. may need to change to your workspace
2. Go to Github and start a new repository.

3. Use the command prompt to make the connections.


a. Navigate to the correct location. Looking for src and bin folders.

Move to the E: drive:
```
C:\Users\LAB>E:
```
*dir* shows what is in the directory.
```
E:\>dir
 Volume in drive E has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is CF21-6DC3

 Directory of E:\

              14 Dir(s)   8,059,305,984 bytes free
```
*cd COMSC_1033_Workspace* Changes to the correct eclipse workspace.
```
E:\>cd COMSC_1033_Workspace

E:\COMSC_1033_Workspace>cd Listing-4_16 
```
Use *dir* again to make sure we can see the src and bin files.
```
E:\COMSC_1033_Workspace\Listing-4_16 >dir
 Volume in drive E has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is CF21-6DC3
